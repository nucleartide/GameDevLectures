# Better Playtesting for Indie Developers

## Motivation

Playtesting is a key part of any indie game developer's dev process, yet the glaring question I have is "where do I find people to play my game?"

You could ask your family or friends, but they may not be your game's target market. Steve Bromley sets us straight by outlining a clear method for approaching playtesting as a time- and resource-strapped indie developer.

## Raw notes

- playtestkit
- iteration is the secret weapon
- solo devs, people who do playtesting as part of their role
- indie game developer
- playtest process
- PLAN
    - decide the focus of your playtest
    - review the state of your build
    - align the team behind the playtest objectives and approach
- PREPARE
    - pick the appropriate research method
    - recruit your playtesters, and gather consent and NDA
        - finding high quality playtesters. most teams recruit based on convenience
            - friends and family
            - university game dev courses
            - your fans
            - these are not your actual players.
                - their prior knowledge, opinions, behavior, and feedback is different
            - reliable and representative playtesters
            - process
                - define target player
                    - what they play
                    - what they buy
                    - bunch of questions at 13:44
                    - define based on behavior
                - make place to keep them
                    - mailing list is best (mailchimp or convertkit)
                - create an incentive
                    - otherwise the playtesters you have are biased (whether because they know you, or otherwise)
                    - money
                    - recognition
                    - other games
                    - feedback
                    - publicity
                - find where they hang out
                    - we’re going to look for where they hang out online
                    - watering holes
                    - other games they’re playing
                    - reddit, typical players
                    - USPs for other things (music, dinosaurs, user-generated content, competitive)
                    - online work for hire communities
                    - offline meeting places (arcades, coffee shops, university campus)
                    - be careful with playtest specific communities
                    - use your player definition to create a screener (questionnaire to see if they match the player type)
                - make a compelling offer
                    - what are you offering
                    - what is compelling about your game
                    - what is expected from them
                    - best possible pitch for the playtest
                - scheduling
                    - calendly and screensharing
                - you can outsource this if you have budget (recruitment companies will handle this)
                - this is critical. every other step is pointless if you don’t get this right.
    - prepare the build
        - infinite reasons to put off playtesting (28:29)
        - you will hear feedback in steam reviews later
        - how to identify most important things to playtest
            - everything is a hypothesis
            - create a hypotheses log
            - “Players will X, because of Y”
        - ranked by risk, sheet
            - don’t need to playtest things you know will work
            - fit into your project management tool
            - assess features ready for playtesting
                - mock up what isn’t ready
            - a small validation playtest is better than nothing
                - be quiet, watch them play
            - list of most important things to playtest as soon as the decision is made
    - design the playtest study
    - prepare playtest technology
    - pilot your playtest
- COLLECT
    - moderate playtest sessions
    - take notes
    - record survey responses
    - store consent and participant data
- ACTION
    - analyze the raw data and reveal the conclusions
    - share your conclusions with the team
    - turn your conclusions into actions
- five areas where playtesting fails
    - find high quality playtesters
    - finding the right time to playtest (within your process)
    - make the most of your player’s time
        - surveys
        - free-form discord feedback
        - self-reported data is bad, misses the data that you need to make the right change
        - player’s behavior
        - did they miss a mechanic
        - did they see the twist
        - what did players not understand
        - how to pick the right method
        - hypothesis testing
        - playtest methods
            - live observation
            - unmoderated, pre-recorded observation, playtestcloud, antidote
            - surveys
            - interviews
            - analytics, telemetry
        - stuck? just watch a few people play
        - deep information gathered from a few people
        - a usability lab doesn’t have to be high tech (webcam, monitor, keyboard, mouse, laptop
        - record the session
            - hand them your device and record, or record through Zoom or Google Meet
        - to measure something, use a survey
        - to understand, observe
        - to understand why, ask
    - dealing with the data from playtests
        - huge amounts of raw data
        - behavior data
        - interview data
        - takes too long to process
        - how to handle playtest data
        - remember why (your playtest plan)
        - split into behavior and opinion data
        - behavior data is objective, and the safest to take action on
            - understand why it occurred (player didn’t see button)
            - decide on fix (label the button)
            - prioritize the fix
        - opinion data
            - enemy is annoying
            - game would be better with shotgun
        - decide fix, prioritize fix
    - deciding what to do next in your project
        - impact on the player
        - consider multiple solutions
        - prioritize your actions
        - iterate to check fixes and discover hidden issues
        - regular small playtests instead of one big playtest
        - more iteration is best
    - some tools to help
        - playtesting doesn’t have to be a big deal
        - think about what you want to learn
        - make pragmatic decisions about how to gather data
        - understand data
        - make decision
        - follow individual player to follow retention
        - get 80 people to playtest at same time
    - playtest kit
        - playtestkit
    - local game shop and local community college
- first-time user experience
    - second time playtester
