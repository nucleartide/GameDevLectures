# Game Dev Lectures

In my journey to become a professional game programmer, I read and watch countless books and videos about different parts of the indie game dev process.

This repo contains notes and syntheses on everything I've learned â€” from GDC talks, Unity talks, podcasts, YouTube lectures, and more.
